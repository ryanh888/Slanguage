## About
---
We created this web application to address the issue of disabled individuals struggling to connect with people within their age group. We hope to accomplish this by creating a tool that allows people to share their messaging habits and the slang they commonly use. This allows people with disabilites to incorporate colloquialism into their own vocabulary so they can more easily connect with the people around them and fully express themselves. We encourage everyone to use this website to learn about their own idiosyncrasies through message statistics.
